# Medical QA with WatsonX and Streamlit

## Project Overview

This project creates a **Medical Question Answering (QA) system** using **IBM WatsonX**'s **FLAN-T5 model**. Users can interact with the model through a **Streamlit web app**.

### Components:

1. **Streamlit App (main.py)**: 
    - Interface for users to ask medical questions.
    - Display answers generated by the WatsonX model.

2. **Jupyter Notebook (medical_qa_watsonx_notebook.ipynb)**:
    - Perform data exploration and experiments.
    - Evaluate the model's responses on a dataset of medical questions and answers.

### How to Run:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devika248/AI-Powered-Medical-QA.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

4. **Important**: Set up the IBM WatsonX credentials in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`.

### Data:
- The dataset used for testing is `MedQuad.csv` containing medical questions and answers.
